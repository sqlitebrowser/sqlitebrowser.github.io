# DB Browser for SQLite

_DB Browser for SQLite_ (DB4S) is a high quality, visual,
[open source](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser) tool
designed for people who want to create, search, and edit 
[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) or [SQLCipher](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/) database files.
DB4S gives a familiar spreadsheet-like interface on the database
in addition to providing a full SQL query facility.
It works with [Windows](./dl#windows), 
[macOS](./dl#macos), 
and most versions of [Linux](./dl#linux) 
and [Unix](./dl#freebsd).
Documentation for the program is on the [wiki.](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki)
