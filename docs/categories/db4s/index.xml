      <description>Caution:
An issue has been reported where the app fails to launch on macOS Catalina (10.15.x).
We will be tracking and resolving the issue. For more information, see issue #3691.
Note that this issue is now fixed in nightly builds, and a new stable release is planned that includes this change.
We are very excited to release a new stable version after almost three years. ðŸš€
It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since we&amp;rsquo;ve released a new stable version, so there are a lot of changes, see the release notes for more details.</description>

      <description>We are proud to present&amp;hellip; the Apple Silicon (arm64) version of DB Browser for SQLite v3.12.2:
https://download.sqlitebrowser.org/DB.Browser.for.SQLite-arm64-3.12.2.dmg 0c2076e4479cb9db5c85123cfe9750641f92566694ff9f6c99906321a2c424e8 (SHA256 checksum) If you&amp;rsquo;re using one of Apple&amp;rsquo;s M1 or M2 based macOS devices, then this native Apple Silicon version of DB4S should work a bit better than our existing Intel based download.
Additionally, our nightly builds for macOS now have both Intel and Apple Silicon (arm64) downloads available:

      <description>This is a minor maintenance release, primarily to update the internal certificates for anonymous communication with the DBHub.io servers.
You don&amp;rsquo;t need to upgrade unless you&amp;rsquo;re using DBHub.io anonymously. If you&amp;rsquo;re using DBHub.io with your own client certificate, this upgrade won&amp;rsquo;t really do much either. ðŸ˜„
The changes in this over the 3.12.1 release include:
Fix saving the list of extensions in the Preferences dialog (bd0e1feead6bb446f8a703338aa9893bf281e5b4) Corrected a typo in the French translation (3bbd4ee271f98301476143749f7bf4abed052efe) Updated the included SQLite and SQLCipher libraries to their latest release (SQLite 3.</description>

      <description>Thanks to our wonderful Patrons, we&amp;rsquo;ve been able to purchase a HiDPI monitor (Dell P2415Q) for Martin, one of our senior developers.
A special thanks also goes to Nikolay Zlatev of Astra Paging too, for organising the purchase and shipping of the monitor around the EU.
This should enable - or at least strongly help - with fixing the remaining HiDPI related bugs that people have reported over the years.</description>
