      <title>New download and daily users stats page</title>

      <description>Today we added a new &amp;ldquo;Stats&amp;rdquo; page, showing the number of daily downloads and daily users:&#xA;https://sqlitebrowser.org/stats/&#xA;The graphs are generated using Redash, and should automatically update every 10 minutes:&#xA;https://redash.io&#xA;Being able to mouse over a particular day to get info for that day is useful, as is being able to download the data set (in various formats, but not yet SQLite &amp;#x1f609;).&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s running in a very low end virtual machine (eg cheap), and there&amp;rsquo;s no proper caching layer yet, so it may be a bit slow to load.</description>

      <title>Added public web stats using Fathom</title>

      <description>Added (GDPR compliant) stats generation today for the website, using Fathom. It&amp;rsquo;s an Open Source project, written in Go, that aims to provide aggregated stats simply, without any user tracking.&#xA;The setup was fairly easy, though the ARM64 download for the current release (1.2.1) doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to work with SQLite due to an accidental setting during their build. Hopefully fixed for the next release.&#xA;PostgreSQL is being the database, and Nginx providing HTTPS termination.</description>
