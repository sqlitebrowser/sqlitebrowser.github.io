      <description>The macOS installer for 3.11.1 has been updated, so now when the application runs it does so in &amp;ldquo;light theme mode&amp;rdquo; (the Aqua look) on macOS Mojave. &amp;#x1f604;&#xA;https://download.sqlitebrowser.org/DB.Browser.for.SQLite-3.11.1v2.dmg&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s a workaround for anyone using Mojave in Dark mode, which Qt doesn&amp;rsquo;t yet properly support. Without this workaround, the colour pallete was unusable in important places. eg white on white when browsing data &amp;#x1f626;&#xA;Jesse Jackson, thank you so much for showing us how to fix this problem.</description>

      <description>Note that this is effectively 3.11.0 from last week, with a critical bug fix on top + some other additional fixes.&#xA;Note 2 - If you&amp;rsquo;re using Dark Mode on macOS Mojave, Do Not download this release. Dark Mode support is broken (badly) on MacOS. It should (hopefully) be fixed in the next point release.&#xA;Highlights DBHub.io improvements CSV import: speed, memory usage, usability, type detection and new default rules Attach databases Menu options for filtering JSON and XML editors Improvements to the plot UI Better copy &amp;amp; paste support Dark theme support on Linux Dark mode support for windows and macOS isn&amp;rsquo;t working yet.</description>

      <description>A serious bug has been found in the recent 3.11.0 release&amp;hellip; newly encrypting databases doesn&amp;rsquo;t work (#1732), instead displaying an error message. &amp;#x1f626;&#xA;Existing databases - encrypted or not - can be opened without problem. The problem only occurs when attempting to newly encrypt a database.&#xA;The links on our download page have been reverted back to the prior stable release (3.10.1) for now, while we look into this.&#xA;There will probably be a 3.</description>
