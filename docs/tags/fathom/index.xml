      <description>Added (GDPR compliant) stats generation today for the website, using Fathom. It&amp;rsquo;s an Open Source project, written in Go, that aims to provide aggregated stats simply, without any user tracking.&#xA;The setup was fairly easy, though the ARM64 download for the current release (1.2.1) doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to work with SQLite due to an accidental setting during their build. Hopefully fixed for the next release.&#xA;PostgreSQL is being the database, and Nginx providing HTTPS termination.</description>
