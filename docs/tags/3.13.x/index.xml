      <description>Caution:
An issue has been reported where the app fails to launch on macOS Catalina (10.15.x).
We will be tracking and resolving the issue. For more information, see issue #3691.
Note that this issue is now fixed in nightly builds, and a new stable release is planned that includes this change.
We are very excited to release a new stable version after almost three years. ðŸš€
It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since we&amp;rsquo;ve released a new stable version, so there are a lot of changes, see the release notes for more details.</description>
